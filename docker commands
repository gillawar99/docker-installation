docker container run -dt --name nginx-container nginx
# here we are creating a container with image nginx
# nginx-container is the name of the container and nginx is the image name

# we can create our custom own images for that we need to create a docker file[set to instructions that makes up the image]
  dockerfile for a sample node application(backend):
      FROM node:16              -it is a base image
      RUN  mkdir /doc-prac      -creating a folder inside the container to store code
      WORKDIR /doc-prac         -creating a path
      COPY . /doc-prac          -copying the code from the current working directory to the folder which is in the container
      RUN npm install
      RUN npx prisma generate   -build commands
      RUN npm run build
      EXPOSE                    -allowing the traffic
      CMD ["npm", "start"]      -This instructs Docker to run the command npm start when the container starts.
  #CMD -is used to specify the default command that should be executed when a container is run from a image 
  #RUN -is used to execute the commands during the image is build
